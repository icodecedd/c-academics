# C Academic Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of academic exercises and projects in C programming, developed to strengthen my understanding of core computer science concepts and problem-solving skills taught in class.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Each section explores fundamental areas of C programming covered in coursework:

- **Functions** â€“ Practice on modular code design and function implementation.  
- **Arrays** â€“ Exercises on one-dimensional and multi-dimensional array operations.  
- **Strings** â€“ Hands-on activities with string manipulation and standard library functions.  
- **Pointers** â€“ Academic problems covering pointer basics, arithmetic, and advanced usage.  
- **File Handling** â€“ Activities on reading from and writing to files using `fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, etc.  
- **Data Structures** â€“ Implementations using `struct` to define and manage complex data types.  
- **Basic Algorithms** â€“ Sorting, searching, and logic-based challenges to build computational thinking.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository serves as:  
- A record of C programming lessons and exercises from class  
- A practice ground for applying theoretical concepts through coding  
- A reference hub for reinforcing fundamental computer science skills
